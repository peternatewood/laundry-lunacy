# Laundry Lunacy

A physics-based laundry game. The washers have no doors! Catch the laundry with your laundry basket and toss them back in before time runs out! I built this game for the 48-hour GMTK Game Jam 2020.

## Controls

- Hover your mouse over the laundry basket and press and hold the Spacebar to pick it up.
- While holding the basket, you can turn it a quarter turn to empty its contents.
- Turn the basket left or right by holding the Left Mouse Button or Right Mouse Button.
